You can deploy the project on any modern static hosting service like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**.

### Example (Vercel)

Your project will be live at your generated Vercel domain (you can later connect your own domain).

## 🔗 Custom Domain Setup

To add a custom domain:

1. Go to your hosting provider’s **Domain Settings**.
2. Add your domain name (example: `www.myproductads.ai`).
3. Update your DNS records as instructed by your hosting provider.
4. Wait for propagation, and your site will be live with your domain.

Would you like me to make this version include a **Demo** section (with “Try it here” and screenshots placeholders) to make it look even more like a public AI product site?
